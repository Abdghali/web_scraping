Web Scraping Sports Match Data from Yallakora.com

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to perform web scraping to extract sports match data from Yallakora.com. The script fetches data for a given date and stores the extracted information in a CSV file for further analysis.

Prerequisites
To run the web scraping script, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you'll need to install the following libraries:

Requests: Used for making HTTP requests to fetch the web page.
BeautifulSoup: Used for parsing the HTML content of the page.
CSV: Used for writing the extracted data to a CSV file.
You can install these libraries using pip:


pip install requests beautifulsoup4


Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Abdghali/web_scraping.git
Run the Python script with the desired date:


python yallakora.py
The script will prompt you to enter a date in the format MM/DD/YYYY. After providing the date, the script will scrape the match data for that day from Yallakora.com and save it in a file named 'match_details.csv' in the same directory.
